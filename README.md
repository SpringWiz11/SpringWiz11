**`Software Craftsman (Data Scientist/ Developer/ Photographer)`**

I am an undergrad student studying Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kerala (IIIT-Kottayam). I have deep passion towards Data Science and aspire to be a Data Scientist and Computer Scientist. 

I am currently working on Full stack projects which includes advanced Machine Learning(ML), Artificial Neural Networks(ANN), Convolution Neural Networks(CNN), React Native, MongoDB, Jera, Firebase and keycloak.

I have deep working knowledge of modern Full-Stack development and Data Science.

All coding projects are built from the ground up, from detailed planning and designed engineering all the way to solve real-life problems with modern computation.
